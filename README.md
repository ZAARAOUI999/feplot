# FEplot
A visualization tool for FElupe. 

FEplot is based on the polpular visualization library matplotlib which is used generally to create 2D plots. The fantastic thing that comes with FEplot is that matplotlib becomes able to plot 3D FEA results and I mean volume results not surfaces.

## Setup
To run this project, you can easily install it locally using pip:
```
pip install feplot
```
All is ready now, let's move on!

## How to Use

Starting with a 2D case:

```python
import felupe as fem
from feplot.pylab import Plotter

# 2D Mesh case
# Get some data to plot
# Create mesh
mesh = fem.Rectangle(b=(10,10), n=20)
# Create region
region = fem.RegionQuad(mesh)
# Create field
field = fem.FieldsMixed(region, n=1)
# Create material
material = fem.NeoHooke(mu=1, bulk=1)
# Create solidbody
solid = fem.SolidBody(material, field)
# Set boundaries conditions (uniaxial test)
boundaries, _ = fem.dof.uniaxial(field,right=10, clamped=True)
# Define displacement amplitude 
move = fem.math.linsteps([0,15],5)
ramp = {boundaries['move']:move}
# Create step
step = fem.Step([solid], ramp, boundaries)
# Create job and burn it!
job = fem.Job([step])
job.evaluate(verbose=False)

# Plot displacements along x-axis 
pl = Plotter() 
pl.plot_displacement(field, label='U$_1$', component=0, show_mesh=True, deformed=True,
                     show_min_max=True)
```
You will get this ðŸ‘‡

For the 3D case, just we will replace the mesh and the region definitions. Then, we have:
```python
# Create mesh
mesh = fem.Cube(b=(10,10,10), n=10)
# Create region
region = fem.RegionHexahedron(mesh)
```
After running your code, you will get this ðŸ‘‡

You can choose a specified view plane, for e.g. : the XY plane, simply add the following line:

```python
pl.xy_view()
```
The result should be like this ðŸ‘‡
